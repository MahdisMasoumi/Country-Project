# Country-Project
This project showcases the implementation of modern JavaScript techniques for building responsive web applications by creating an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file that displays information about countries through the Rest Countries API. The HTML file defines the webpage's structure, the CSS file provides styling, and the JavaScript file uses AJAX to retrieve data from the API and render it dynamically. The webpage displays country information such as name, flag, region, population, languages, and currencies, and users can also retrieve their current location to display nearby country information. Moreover, the project demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript via the Fetch API and contains a function to handle errors in case the API call fails.
