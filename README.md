# Country-Project
The project involves creating an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file that displays information about countries using the Rest Countries API. The HTML file defines the structure of the webpage, the CSS file provides styling for the webpage, and the JavaScript file uses AJAX to retrieve data from the API and dynamically render it on the webpage. The webpage displays country information such as name, flag, region, population, languages, and currencies. Additionally, the webpage allows users to retrieve their current location and display nearby country information. The project demonstrates skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, and API integration.
